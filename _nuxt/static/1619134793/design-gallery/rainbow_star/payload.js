As they were starting a new community-supported agriculture (CSA) program, they were looking to give their farm a professional redesign to entice the local student population. Needing a way to get the word out about the CSA, and hoping to show off their seasonal produce, they requested an eye-catching and informative flyer to communicate the program goals. One aspect of their program they were sure to emphasize was their free-range eggs, produced by their lovely chickens - who I got to meet! I wanted to make the chickens the star of the show, and so I represented them front-and-center in the farm's fun new logo."}]},{type:a,value:"\n"},{type:c,tag:d,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:"Crafted with Adobe Illustrator"}]}]},dir:"\u002Fitems",path:"\u002Fitems\u002Frainbow_star",extension:".md",createdAt:e,updatedAt:e},primary:void 0,images:b}],fetch:{},mutations:[]}}("text",Array(3),"element","p","2021-04-22T23:39:21.585Z")));
